# LAD-ME
Likelihood-based surrogate dimension reduction.


This MATLAB code implements the likelihood-based estimator for the central subspace when measurement error is present in the covariates.

The file examples.m contains computation of different estimators, including both the unpenalized and penalized corrected LAD estimators, on a simulated dataset.
